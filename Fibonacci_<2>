    What is the Fibonacci Sequence?

    The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number 
    (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones.
    It usually starts with 0 and 1, or 1 and 2. For example:
    
      0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
    
    - The 3rd number is 1 (0 + 1)
    - The 4th number is 2 (1 + 1)
    - The 5th number is 3 (1 + 2)
    - The 6th number is 5 (2 + 3)
    - And so on...

    This sequence appears in many areas of mathematics, nature, art, and computer science.
    In this program, we generate Fibonacci numbers and calculate the sum of the even ones up to 4,000,000.

  // The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
  int previousNumber = 1;

  // This variable will store the sum of even Fibonacci numbers
  int evenSum = 0;

  // We continue generating Fibonacci numbers as long as the current number is less than or equal to 4,000,000
  while (currentNumber <= 4000000) {
    // Check if the current Fibonacci number is even
    if (currentNumber % 2 == 0) {
      // If it's even, add it to the running total
      evenSum += currentNumber;
    }

    // Calculate the next Fibonacci number by adding the last two numbers
    int nextNumber = previousNumber + currentNumber;

    // Move forward in the sequence:
    // The current number becomes the previous, and the next becomes current
    previousNumber = currentNumber;
    currentNumber = nextNumber;
  }

  // Print the result: the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers up to 4,000,000
