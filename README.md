# Project Euler Solutions in Dart

This repository contains my solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), implemented in the Dart programming language.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is **educational**:
- Help beginner programmers read and understand simple, well-commented code.
- Make it easier to grasp both programming techniques and mathematical concepts through practical examples.

## About

- Each problem is placed in its own file, following the format `problem_<number>.dart`.
- Solutions include comments explaining the approach and logic, making the code easier to follow and understand.
- Mathematical reasoning and concepts are explained where relevant in the comments.

Learning mathematical concepts and programming techniques is part of the process.

For more information, visit the [Project Euler website](https://projecteuler.net/).

## License

- **No direct answers** to the problems are provided in this repository.
- This repository is for educational purposes. Please respect the Project Euler guidelines and refrain from sharing direct answers to the problems.
